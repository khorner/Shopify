───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

** Description **
The error you're encountering during the `npm install` process is due to an engine compatibility issue. Here's a breakdown of the error message and how to resolve it:

### Error Breakdown

1. **Error Code: EBADENGINE**
   - This indicates that there is a problem with the version of Node.js or npm being used, which does not meet the requirements specified in the package's `package.json` file.

2. **Unsupported Engine**
   - The versions of Node.js and/or npm you are using are not supported by the package you're trying to install.

3. **Required Node.js Version**
   - The package requires Node.js versions `^18.20`, `^20.10`, or `^22`.

4. **Actual Versions**
   - You are currently using npm version `10.2.4` and Node.js version `v21.6.1`, which do not meet the required versions.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, you need to switch to a compatible version of Node.js that meets the requirements specified in the error message. Here are the steps to do this:

1. **Check Current Node.js and npm Versions**
   - Run the following commands to check your current Node.js and npm versions:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

2. **Install a Compatible Node.js Version**
   - Use a version manager like `nvm` (Node Version Manager) to install a compatible version of Node.js. For example, to install Node.js `18.20`, run:
     ```bash
     nvm install 18.20
     nvm use 18.20
     ```

3. **Verify the Installation**
   - Ensure that you are now using the correct version of Node.js by running:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
     It should output `v18.20` or another compatible version specified in the error message.

4. **Re-run npm install**
   - Once you have switched to a compatible version of Node.js, run the `npm install` command again to install the dependencies.

### Example Commands

Here’s a step-by-step example using `nvm`:

1. Install `nvm` if you don’t have it already:
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. Source `nvm` (you might need to add this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):
   ```bash
   export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
   ```

3. Install the required Node.js version:
   ```bash
   nvm install 18.20
   nvm use 18.20
   ```

4. Verify the Node.js version:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

5. Run the `npm install` command again:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the engine compatibility issue and successfully run the `npm install` command.

npm error
npm error If you believe this might be a permissions issue, please double-check the
npm error permissions of the file and its containing directories, or try running
npm error the command again as root/Administrator.

### Description
The error you are encountering is related to file permissions. Specifically, the `npm install` command is trying to access or modify the `package-lock.json` file, but it doesn't have the necessary permissions to do so.

### Solutions

#### 1. Change File Permissions

You can change the permissions of the `package-lock.json` file to allow the current user to access it:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP /Users/khorner/package-lock.json
```

Replace `$GROUP` with your user’s primary group if needed. This command changes the ownership of the file to the current user, which should resolve the permissions issue.

#### 2. Run npm install with sudo

Alternatively, you can run the `npm install` command with `sudo` to execute it with root privileges. This is not always recommended for security reasons, but it can be a quick fix:

```bash
sudo npm install
```

#### 3. Change Directory Permissions

If the issue persists, it might be due to directory permissions. You can change the permissions of the entire project directory:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP /Users/khorner/project-directory
```

Replace `project-directory` with the name of your project directory.

### Best Practices

- **Avoid Running npm as Root:** Running `npm` with `sudo` can lead to permission issues and security risks. It’s better to fix the permissions of the files and directories involved.
- **Use a Version Manager:** Using `nvm` or similar tools helps avoid permission issues by managing Node.js installations in the user’s home directory.

### Example Steps

1. **Check Current User and Group:**

   ```bash
   whoami
   id -gn
   ```

2. **Change Ownership of the File:**

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(id -gn) /Users/khorner/package-lock.json
   ```

3. **Change Ownership of the Project Directory (if needed):**

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(id -gn) /Users/khorner/project-directory
   ```

4. **Run npm install Again:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Following these steps should resolve the permissions issue and allow you to successfully run the `npm install` command.
